# Hydration Error Fixes

## Problem
The Next.js application was experiencing hydration errors due to mismatches between server-side rendering (SSR) and client-side rendering. This typically happens when components render differently on the server vs the client.

## Root Causes Identified

1. **Mobile Detection Hooks**: Multiple hooks (`useIsMobile`, `useMobileDetection`) were returning different values during SSR vs client-side
2. **Conditional Rendering**: Components using `isMounted` state were rendering differently on server vs client
3. **Client-Side Only Logic**: Components accessing `window`, `document`, or `navigator` without proper SSR handling

## Solutions Applied

### 1. Created Hydration-Safe Hooks (`hooks/use-hydration-safe.ts`)

- `useIsClient()`: Safely detects if component is mounted on client
- `useHydrationSafe<T>()`: Handles values that differ between SSR and client
- `useSafeMobileDetection()`: Safe mobile detection without hydration issues

### 2. Updated Mobile Detection Hooks

**Before:**
```typescript
if (!isMounted) {
  return false;
}
return isMobile;
```

**After:**
```typescript
return isMounted ? isMobile : false;
```

### 3. Updated Components to Use Safe Patterns

**Components Updated:**
- `components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
- `components/mobile-optimizer.tsx`
- `components/layout/header.tsx`
- `components/ui/floating-buttons.tsx`
- `app/ClientWrapper.tsx`
- `components/ui/performance-optimizer.tsx`

**Pattern Applied:**
```typescript
const isClient = useIsClient();

useEffect(() => {
  if (!isClient) return;
  // Client-side only logic here
}, [isClient]);
```

### 4. Created Hydration Debugger

Added `components/ui/hydration-debugger.tsx` to help identify hydration issues during development.

## Key Principles Applied

1. **Consistent SSR/Client Rendering**: Components now render the same content on both server and client initially
2. **Progressive Enhancement**: Client-side features are added after hydration
3. **Safe Window Access**: All `window`/`document` access is wrapped in `useIsClient()` checks
4. **Default Values**: Mobile detection returns safe defaults during SSR

## Testing

1. **Development Mode**: Run `npm run dev` and check for hydration warnings in console
2. **Production Build**: Run `npm run build && npm start` to test production behavior
3. **Hydration Debugger**: Check browser console for hydration-related logs

## Files Modified

- `hooks/use-hydration-safe.ts` (new)
- `hooks/use-mobile.tsx`
- `components/ui/use-mobile.tsx`
- `hooks/use-mobile-detection.ts`
- `components/ui/sidebar.tsx`
- `components/mobile-optimizer.tsx`
- `components/layout/header.tsx`
- `components/ui/floating-buttons.tsx`
- `app/ClientWrapper.tsx`
- `components/ui/performance-optimizer.tsx`
- `components/ui/hydration-debugger.tsx` (new)
- `app/page.tsx`

## Expected Results

- No more hydration errors in console
- Consistent rendering between server and client
- Proper mobile detection after hydration
- Better performance and user experience
